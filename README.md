# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In course of this challenge I have solidified my knowledge about flexbox. I have tried to make this project as responsive as possible - ranging from defined 375px to 1440px.
